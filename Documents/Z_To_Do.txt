General
the application should have a listener full time.
The water level sensor needs to raise the complaint in the Alibaba and reorder the sensor.
Parallelly check the other sources also.
Buy water level sensor and Industrial Pi from the local market.
Check the cost of the Flowmeter having a one-inch diameter.
Check all the adapters and their qualities used in the project.
Need to create a detailed description of the implementation of sensors on the site (How, Place, and Connection Diagram).
Need to implement the Energymeter and STP Sensor integration on June 17.
Need to consider the structure scalability.
Need to create a complete documentation of 
        Configuration of Gateway hub in the web interface.
        Configuration of Gateway address in the internal network.
        Implementation of sensors in the live site.

Technical
Define all the ports of all the Gateway hubs (Need to know the number of sensors used in the project).

Tasks
1. Get information from Azure IoT.
2. Save the data from Azure in a log file.
3. Clear all sensor setups, including the frequency time, if the message is "RESET."
4. Set the configuration of Energymeter if the message is "Energymeter" with "Device ID."
5. Set the COD, BOD, and TSS sensor configuration if the notification says "COD, BOD, and TSS" with "Device ID."
6. Threading must be used to run the receiving and transmitting functions in parallel.
