First Phase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two methods:
	The required sensors are combined into a single commercially available module.
	Some sensors are missing from the module and must be added separately.
	
	Separately integrating each identical sensor. 
	Each sensor may be found on the market.
	
Integrated Module:
	The majority of the sensors are built inside the module. 
	Sensors that are not included in the module are added separately. 
	It's easy to set up. 
	The corporation receives the patent. 
	The price is high. 
	Installation carries a low risk.
	
	Parameters included:
	BOD, COD, TOC, DOC, Dissolved Oxygen, Pressure, Chloride, pH, Temperature, 
	Optical Brighteners, Nitrate, ORP / REDOX, Coliforms (faecal, E. coli, total), 
	Tryptophan, Refined Oils, Ammonium, EC / Salinity / TDS, Turbidity, Crude Oils CDOM.
	
	Parameters not included:
	TSS, VS, Flow rate.

Identical Sensors:
	Sensors are connected in a separate way. 
	Each sensor has the same specs as the others and must be obtained separately from the market. 
	Installing it is difficult. 
	By combining all of the sensors, we developed it on our own. 
	The price is low. 
	Installation carries a significant level of risk. 
	Availability is contingent on various suppliers.
