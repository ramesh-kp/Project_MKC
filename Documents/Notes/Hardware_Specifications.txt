Sensors
-------
1.	PH Sensor
2.	Turbidity Sensor
3.	TSS Sensor - Total Suspended Solids
4.	TDS Sensor - Total Dissolved Solids
5.	COD Sensor - Chemical Oxygen Demand
6.	BOD Sensor - Biochemical Oxygen Demand
7.	Coliform Sensor
8.	Flow Meter
9.	Water Level Sensor
10.	RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device
11. Power Source

All sensors must have 12v power supply and RS485 modbus output.
The vendors must give the complete datasheet of the sensors.
The datasheet must have the complete details of datas for communication.
What data is to send, how the data is recieved and how the data is converted to readable values.
Details of the frequecy of communication also needed.

The first 7 sensors come under STP sensors.

For flowmeter sensors the diameter of the sensor depends on the diameter of the pipes.
Already MKC have 3 different diameter pipes.
Flowmeters of 3 different diameters are needed.

There will be 2 type of water level sensors.
Wired water level sensor and Ultrasonic water level sensor.
Dam and 3 overhead tanks are using wired water level sensor as its depth is of maximum 5m.
The well is using Ultrasonic water level sensor as its depth is above 12m.

The RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device are of mainly 5 types. 
GW1101 (1 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1102 (2 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1104 (4 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1108 (8 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1116 (16 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)

The STP plant need GW1108 RS-485 Ethernet Gateway as there will be more than 5 sensors attached to the gateway.
The overhead tank will also need GW1108 RS-485 Ethernet Gateway.
Depending upon the number of RS-485 inputs the type of RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device will also vary.

Hi,

For the project MKC monitoring system i have to buy one flowmeter sensor and RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device.
