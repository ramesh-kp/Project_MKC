1.	PH Sensor
2.	Turbidity Sensor
3.	TSS Sensor - Total Suspended Solids
4.	TDS Sensor - Total Dissolved Solids
5.	COD Sensor - Chemical Oxygen Demand
6.	BOD Sensor - Biochemical Oxygen Demand
7.	Coliform Sensor
8.	Flow Meter
9.	Water Level Sensor
10.	RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device
11. Power Source

All sensors must have 12v power supply and RS485 modbus output.
The vendors must give the complete datasheet of the sensors.
The datasheet must have the complete details of datas for communication.
What data is to send, how the data is recieved and how the data is converted to readable values.
Details of the frequecy of communication also needed.

The first 7 sensors come under STP sensors.

For flowmeter sensors the diameter of the sensor depends on the diameter of the pipes.
Already MKC have 3 different diameter pipes.
Flowmeters of 3 different diameters are needed.

There will be 2 type of water level sensors.
Wired water level sensor and Ultrasonic water level sensor.
Dam and 3 overhead tanks are using wired water level sensor as its depth is of maximum 5m.
The well is using Ultrasonic water level sensor as its depth is above 12m.

The RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device are of mainly 5 types. 
GW1101 (1 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1102 (2 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1104 (4 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1108 (8 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1116 (16 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)

The STP plant need GW1108 RS-485 Ethernet Gateway as there will be more than 5 sensors attached to the gateway.
The overhead tank will also need GW1108 RS-485 Ethernet Gateway.
Depending upon the number of RS-485 inputs the type of RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device will also vary.

Detailed Explanation
--------------------
Flowmeter
    The output of the sensor is of a pulse with a 16 bit resolution.
    
    Minimum conductivity 
        The conductivity of the media must be greater than 20 µS/cm.
    Liner selection
        Use hard rubber lining for drinking water and waste water.
        Use PFA/FEP lining suitable under vacuum line.
    Electrode selection
        S.S. 316 / S.S. 316L for general purpose, sewage, water and district heating systems
    Mounting location
        There must be no flow fluctuations.
        Avoid locations where vacuum can occur; especially for flow sensors with PTFE linings.
        Avoid locations with vibrations from for example pumps.
        Avoid locations with extensive temperature changes.
        Avoid corrosive environments and locations with a great risk of condensation, or consult 
            factory for special builds for these locations.
        Take care that condensate and water cannot enter the connector box on the flow sensor.
        There must be sufficient free space around the flow sensor.
    Pressure Loss
        Decreasing the internal diameter from 100 mm (DN) to 80 mm (DO) will cause a pressure 
            loss of 0.003 Bar @ 3 m/s.
    Accuracy
        The measuring accuracy will be better than ± 0.5%, provided that the flow sensor has 
            the correct dimension.
    Sizing of Flow Sensor
        Flowtech recommends that flow velocities in tubes are kept between 1 – 3 m/s for 
            reliable and safe operation.
    EMF Type Guidelines
        Integral Type : Suitable for ground level and upto 5 feet above ground level or vertical
            lines upto 10 feet.
        Remote Type : Suitable for overhead lines or limitations of vertical space.
        Wafer Type : Suitable for bigger size lines as well as limitations of pipe length.
        TC Joint : Suitable for food industries.
    



Hi,

For the project MKC monitoring system i have to buy one flowmeter sensor and RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device.
