11. Power Source

All sensors must be powered by 12 volts and have an RS485 modbus output.
The sensors' entire datasheet must be provided by the manufacturers.
The datasheet must contain all of the necessary data for communication.
What data should be sent, how should it be received, and how should it be turned into usable values?
The frequency of transmission must also be specified.

The first seven sensors are classified as STP sensors.

The diameter of flowmeter sensors is determined by the diameter of the pipes.
MKC already has three distinct pipe diameters.
Three different diameter flowmeters are required.

Water level sensors will be of two types.
There are two types of water level sensors: wired and ultrasonic.
Because the depth of the dam and the three above tanks is no more than 5 metres, a wired water level sensor is used.
Because the depth of the well exceeds 12 metres, an ultrasonic water level sensor is used.

The RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device are of mainly 5 types. 
GW1101 (1 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1102 (2 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1104 (4 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1108 (8 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)
GW1116 (16 RS-485 to Ethernet Gateway)

Because there will be more than 5 sensors connected to the gateway, the STP plant will require the GW1108 RS-485 Ethernet Gateway.
The GW1108 RS-485 Ethernet Gateway will also be required for the above tank.
The kind of RS-485 Ethernet Edge Device will differ depending on the quantity of RS-485 inputs.

Detailed Explanation
--------------------
Flowmeter
    The output of the sensor is of a pulse with a 16 bit resolution.
    
    Minimum conductivity 
        The conductivity of the media must be greater than 20 µS/cm.
    Liner selection
        Use hard rubber lining for drinking water and waste water.
        Use PFA/FEP lining suitable under vacuum line.
    Electrode selection
        S.S. 316 / S.S. 316L for general purpose, sewage, water and district heating systems
    Mounting location
        There must be no flow fluctuations.
        Avoid locations where vacuum can occur; especially for flow sensors with PTFE linings.
        Avoid locations with vibrations from for example pumps.
        Avoid locations with extensive temperature changes.
        Avoid corrosive environments and locations with a great risk of condensation, or consult 
            factory for special builds for these locations.
        Take care that condensate and water cannot enter the connector box on the flow sensor.
        There must be sufficient free space around the flow sensor.
    Pressure Loss
        Decreasing the internal diameter from 100 mm (DN) to 80 mm (DO) will cause a pressure 
            loss of 0.003 Bar @ 3 m/s.
    Accuracy
        The measuring accuracy will be better than ± 0.5%, provided that the flow sensor has 
            the correct dimension.
    Sizing of Flow Sensor
        Flowtech recommends that flow velocities in tubes are kept between 1 – 3 m/s for 
            reliable and safe operation.
    EMF Type Guidelines
        Integral Type : Suitable for ground level and upto 5 feet above ground level or vertical
            lines upto 10 feet.
        Remote Type : Suitable for overhead lines or limitations of vertical space.
        Wafer Type : Suitable for bigger size lines as well as limitations of pipe length.
        TC Joint : Suitable for food industries.
