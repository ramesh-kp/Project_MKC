Ph Sensor:
	The pH stands for the power of hydrogen, which is a measurement of the 
	hydrogen ion concentration in the body. This is used in Water quality 
	testing and Aquaculture. The total pH scale ranges from 1 to 14, with 7 
	considered to be neutral. A pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and 
	solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline.
	The PH electrode has a single cylinder that allows direct connection to 
	the input terminal of a pH meter, controller, or any pH device which has a 
	BNC input terminal. The pH electrode probe is accurate and reliable that 
	can give almost instantaneous readings.
	
Turbidity Sensor:
	Turbidity sensors measure the amount of light that is scattered by the 
	suspended solids in water. As the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) 
	in water increases, the water’s turbidity level (and cloudiness or 
	haziness) increases. Turbidity sensors are used in river and stream 
	gaging, wastewater and effluent measurements, control instrumentation 
	for settling ponds, sediment transport research, and laboratory 
	measurements.
	
Total Suspended Solids:
	TSS is an important water quality parameter measure for wastewater 
	treatment operations and environmental health. Wastewater contains large 
	quantities of suspended organic and inorganic material that must be 
	removed through screening, filtration or settling/flotation methods 
	prior to environmental discharge.
	
TDS Sensor:
	This item can be used for water purifiers and filters, food (vegetables, 
	fruits) and beverage quality monitoring, swimming pools, spas, aquariums, 
	and hydroponics.
	

BOD/COD Sensor: 
	Real Tech’s bypass BOD/COD sensor provides affordable real-time 
	measurement of organic matter in water or wastewater. The BOD/COD sensor 
	provides superior measurement performance across multiple wavelengths of 
	light using UV LEDs. Designed to meet the needs of many monitoring 
	applications, the BL series offers multiple sensor path length selections 
	to meet the desired measurement range.
	Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a test that measures the amount of 
	oxygen required to chemically oxidize the organic material and inorganic 
	nutrients, such as Ammonia or Nitrate, present in water. 
	BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) Determination is a simple and easy way for 
	monitoring the microorganisms' activity in water samples with extremely 
	reliable results. The BOD measure this change in gas pressure between the 
	beginning to the end of the analysis and give a result expressed in mg/l.
	
Coliforms:
	Coliforms (coliform bacteria) are rod-shaped gram-negative bacteria that 
	are commonly used as an indicator of the sanitary quality of water. 
	Coliforms are ubiquitous in the environment but are prevalent in the 
	intestine and faecal material of warm-blooded animals. 
	
Flow Rate Sensor:
	A flow sensor (more commonly referred to as a “flow meter”) is an 
	electronic device that measures or regulates the flow rate of liquids and 
	gasses within pipes and tubes. Flow sensors are generally connected to 
	gauges to render their measurements, but they can also be connected to 
	computers and digital interfaces.
