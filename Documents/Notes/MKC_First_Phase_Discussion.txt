Convert the data from the sensors into something useful.
What is the best way to install the sensors?
The RS 485 box's material (Example Iron).
Where should the sensors be installed? (Middle of the pond or side of the pond).
What is the best way to connect the sensor wires?
Where should the RS 485 box be placed? (Rainy season it shoulnot get wet).
Determine where the sensors are.
What are the obstacles to installing at the MKC location?
Everything needs to be double-checked, including the wiring, the box, and the power supply.
Make sure the cables are all the same length.
Where should the power come from? (buliding).
Examine the integrated part's power supply.
Whether the level is in the range of sea level.

************************************************************
Here you'll find a list of available sensors. (Fire sensors and water level sensors)
Take a look at Naico's solutions.

************************************************************
From the standpoint of the sensor manufacturer, what should be kept in mind when installing sensors?
Check out the sensor movies, especially the installation demonstration.
The sensor's output range.

Embedded system activities
    Obtaining installation information.
    Validating the information.
    Prior to installation, determining the functional working.
    Calibration of the installation finetuning.
Python code for calibrating sensor data.
Document the water quality sensors' data interpretations, range, and specifications.


************************************************************
Check to see if the flow metre sensor is affected by pipe size.
Please get in touch with the people who installed the industrial-grade water management sensors.
Check out the guidelines for industrial installation.
Document how to set up each sensor, how to read it, how to calibrate it, and what the results mean.
To discover the readings, look for any water level sensors that use ultrasonic or laser technology.
Make contact with the sensor's manufacturer.
To obtain the sensors, contact the offline distributors (local dealers).
Make a diagram of the connections.
Make a schematic of the sensor installation.
Make a diagram of the data structure.
