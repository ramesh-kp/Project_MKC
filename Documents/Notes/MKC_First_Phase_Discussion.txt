Convert the value coming from the sensors to a meaningful value.
How do we install the sensors.
Material of the RS 485 box (Example Iron).
Where to install the sensors (Middle of the pond or side of the pond).
How do we connect the wires of the sensors.
Where to place the RS 485 box (Rainy season it shoulnot get wet).
Identify the location of the sensors.
What are the challenges to install at the physical MKC location.
Wiring, Putting the Box, Power coming all things need to be checked.
Check the length of the cables.
Where the power should be taken from (buliding).
Check the power source of the embedded part.
Volume of the level whether in the range sea level.

************************************************************
Find here available sensors. (Water level Sensors and Fire Sensors)
Check the solutions provided by Naico.

************************************************************
What are things to takecare as part of installing sensors from the sensors vendor perspective.
Check the videos of the sensors especially demonstration of install.
Range of the sensors output.

Activities in embedded system
    Finding installation details.
    Validating the data.
    Identifying the functional working before installation.
    Installation finetuning calibration.
Python code to calibrate data from the sensors.
Document the Data interpretations, Range and Specifications of the Water quality sensors.


************************************************************
Check whether the flow meter sensor depends upon the size of the pipe.
Contact those persons who have installed the industrial grade water management sensors.
Check the industrial installation guidlines.
Document for each sensors how to install, how to read, how to calibrate and what are the interpretations.
Check whether there is any water level sensors using ultrasound or laser technology to find the readings.
Contact the vendors of each sensors.
Contact with the offline distributers (local vendors) to procur the sensors.
Draw the connection diagram.
Draw sensor installation diagram.
Draw the data structure diagram.
