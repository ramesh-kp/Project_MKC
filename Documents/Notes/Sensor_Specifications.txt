    Output Mode             :   MODBUS RS485    :   pH          :   0 ~ 14 pH   :   pH = pH register value / 100
                                                    Temperature :   -40 ~ 80    :   pH = temperature register value / 100 
    Installation method     :   Under normal circumstances, the pH value in the air is between 6.2 and 7.8.
                                Normal conditions Under the soil, the soil is neutral, the pH value is about 7, the soil in different places, 
                                the actual pH value will be different, it should be determined according to the actual situation.
