STP Sensors
    Power source for the STP sensors will be 12V DC power supply with maximum current rating. 
    Power cable must also have the same length of the transmitter and receiver wire. 
    Sensors must be water proof since the sensors must be dipped in the water. 
    Sensors must be dipped in the minimum direct distance of the plant. 
    Depth of the sewage plant must be of maximum 1000m only the RS485 protocol can communicate.    
    
RS485 To Ethernet Modbus Gateway
    Power source for the RS485 To Ethernet Modbus Gateway will be 12V DC power supply. 
    The gateway must be placed within 1000m from the sensors. 
    The output of the gateway is an ethernet port. M
    Maximum distance ethernet cable for communication is 100m. 
    Server must be within 100m from the gateway. 
    If the server is placed beyond 100m range, the communication between the gateway and the server is done by GSM module. 
    When using the GSM module, the network must have full coverage in the area. 
    There will be a microcontroller for sending the dataâ€™s through the GSM module. 
    GSM have a 12V DC power supply. 
    Need another covering with IP65 box as the existing box is not corrosion free. 
    Commands for communication between gateway and sensors. 
    Server needs to send the command to enable the port. 
    After enabling the port server need to send the command to communicate with the sensors using RS485 protocol. 
    The sensors will send the reading of the inputs according to the commands which will send to the server through gateway.
        
Water Level Sensor
    Power source for the Water Level Sensor will be 12V DC power supply. 
    Mainly 3 water sources are there to calculate the height. Natural well, Mini dam and Overhead Tank. 
    There must be a 12V DC power supply near to the water sources. 
    Wired water level sensors have maximum coverage distance 5m. 
    Ultrasonic water level sensor have a maximum coverage distance of 30m. 
    Sensors must be dipped in the plant. 
    The output of the water level sensor is RS485. 
    The sensor must be placed within 1000m from the gateway.
    
Flow Meter Sensor
    Power source for the Flow Meter Sensor. (12V DC power supply).
    Flow meter is used in overhead tank for getting the total volume of the water consumption.
    Flow meter is used in the kitchen, washroomm and toilets for getting the respective usages.
    In seawage treatment plant flow meter is used in the inlet pipe and outlet pipe for getting the volume of the treated water and its usage. 
    For each flow meter sensor there must be power supply.
    The diameter of the flow meter depends on the diameter of the pipe.
    The output of the water level sensor is RS485. The sensor must be placed within 1000m from the gateway.
  
Energymeter
    230v Ac power supply. 
    Serial output RS485 or USB output. 
    The meter must be placed within 1000m from the gateway.

Dont want exact accuracy of the depth of water source.
Fix with wired water level sensor.

Problems Facing
...............
Volume of the water source must be calculated (Mini dam and well).
Checking the lower bed of the mini dam and well will be difficult.
Position of flow meter sensors (Diameter and number of pipes effect the sensor specifications).
Giving power to the flow meters will be difficult, depending upon the position of the flow meters.
Size of the flow meters will depend on the diameter of the pipe.
Position of water level sensors (Specially the terrain of the water source).

Other Inputs:
-------------
-Q. Will it show the remaining water level (from all 3 sources) (in litres) or will there be any indicator when water level 
    is too low? Will it show warning signal?
-Q. What is the backup if the flow sensor gets damaged due to extreme water pressure on flow.
    Will it show sensor damaged indication.
-Q. Suppose in any case, if the tank is running out of water/empty. Will the sensor send distress signal to the meter?

From the client side
--------------------
Do the sensors need to check water quality in the seawage treatment plant before and after treating the water.
Height of the well, pond and mini dam must be given from the client side.
Check whether we want to check the water quality parameters of water sources like well, dam and pond.

Communication between energymeter and gateway.
Error handling for identifying faulty sensors.

Questions
1.  Protocol used in gateway.
2.  Can Mqtt connection established in gateway.
