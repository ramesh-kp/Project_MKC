1.	Connect the 12v power supply to the TDS sensor, Red to the power cord (VCC), and Black to GND (GND) of the adapter.
2.  The yellow and white wires should be connected to RS485+ (A or D+) and RS485- (B or D-), respectively.
3.  Connect the RS485+ to D+ (1st) and RS485- to D- (2nd) pin of the Gateway hub.
3.  Use the IP address 192.168.1.254 and the port number 502 to connect.
4.  Configure the settings in the Gateway web address.
5.  Change the Alias name (TDS Sensor) and MODBUS Slave ID (120).
6.  Set the Slave ID, Start Address, and Number of Registers in Python Code.
	Slave ID			:	120
    First Register		:	49729
    Number of Registers	:	4
7.	The sensor will give two outputs - TDS and Conductivity
8.  Measurement range:	Conductivity    :1-30000us/cm;
                        TDS：   0-15000mg/L;
                        Salinity：  0-18.5ppt;；0-1.85%；0-18.5g/L
9.	Scope of Measurement:   0～30000μS·cm-1 ；0~500000μS·cm-1
                            Temperature：   0-50 degree celsius
10.	Maintenance and Maintenance
        Check the instrument once a year for the best, if the user unconditionally can be sent to our company to help check.
        The maintenance period of the cleaning electrode can be determined according to the cleanliness of the water sample, 
        and the surface inside and outside the electrode should be free of fouling deposition.
        For stainless steel conductance electrode and platinum conductance electrode, if contamination is found, 
        it should be cleaned in time, brushed with 50% warm detergent (or household soap powder) and nylon brush, 
        and then washed inside the electrode with distilled water. 
        Ensure no grease deposition on the surface of internal and external electrodes. 
        Do not touch the electrode with your fingers; clean the deposit with strong adhesion with 2% dilute hydrochloric acid solution, 
        then wash it with clean water; for platinum black conductance electrode, do not brush the electrode head with brush or 
        other substances, just rinse the electrode head with clean water; keep the cable and plug dry to ensure reliable contact.
