1.	Give 12v power to the device (Ethernet Modbus gateway).
2.	Connect the LAN port to the network LAN.
3.	Change the network to which you're presently connected.
4.	The IPV4 connection should be changed.
5.	192.168.1.51 is the IP address.
6.	255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask.
7.	192.168.0.3 is the default gateway.
8.	502 is the default port number.
9.	When a new sensor is connected to the Modbus gateway, the sensor information and communication details must first be configured
	in the <<< 3onedata >>> website, which may be accessible through the IP <<< 192.168.1.254 >>>.
10.	Select <<< Slave ID >>> from the <<< Modbus Settings >>> menu, change the <<< Channel Type >>> and <<< Slave ID Range >>> to
	<<< RTU Slave >>> and Sensor slave ID, respectively.
11.	After that, transmit the TCP Modbus data to the specified slave id.

Using Realterm Software to check the connection.
	1.	In the display options, choose Hex (Space).
	2.	In the Port option, change the port number to <<< 192.168.1.254:502 >>>.
	3.	In the Echo Port option, change the port number to <<< 192.168.1.254:502 >>>.
	4.	In the Echo Port option, check the boxes for <<< Echo On >>> and <<< Monitor >>>.
	5.	In the Send option, paste the request command.
	6.	To send the data, use the <<< Send Number >>> button.
	7.	The Realterm monitor shows the sensor's response.
