The project scope includes the following application modules:
    Water Resources Management
    Power Resources Management
    Vehicle Parking Space Management
    Environment Monitoring System

Naico will implement a central smart solution encompassing the above management systems.
The data from each management system will be obtained from the above-mentioned management systems and utilized to gain insights.

Scope
High level scope of the entire project is to make MKC Smart.
There are many services that can be automated and controlled via Web Application.
As an initial step, started with four main services as below
    Water Level Monitoring
    Sewage Treat Plan â€“ Monitoring the quality parameters
    Power Consumption Monitoring
    Automated Vehicle Parking System
    Automated environment monitoring system

As a very beginning step of this mass automation, scope was drilled down further to implement monitoring system in one of the MKC
facility called WIRAS (World Institute of Research And Studies) where Water Level Monitoring, STP Quality Parameter Checking and
Power Consumption monitoring will be implemented (Phase 1 part of the Project).

As part of the project, Naico will be providing all the detailed specifications for the implementations of the sensors and related
Data/Power Sources, MKC will be procuring and installing the same on premises.

Naico will be developing a responsive web application that will run on both web and mobile platforms.
There will be 2 types of users: Admin & Tenant.
(Note: As of now, Naico is working with Tropical Environmental Solutions (TES) for developing the monitoring solution for sewage
treatment plant, so MKC & TES together will decide the data integration between STP monitoring system with MKC monitoring dashboard
application.)

Major modules of Monitoring app dashboard include:
Admin & Tenant can login to the dashboard using registered username and password.
Admin will have privilege to view the dashboard of all facilities inside MKC campus while Tenant will have privilege to view the
dashboard of assigned facility.
Admin will have the privilege to add new users and assign the privilege to view data of their respective facilities.
Admin and Tenant dashboard will consist of data related to water resources, power resources and Sewage Treatment Plant.

Out of Scope
    Anything not considered in the proposal will be out of scope.
    VS Sensor for STP are not included in the proposal

The following sensors will be installed during the system's first deployment phase:
    COD Sensor - Chemical Oxygen Demand (Not Get)

    TSS Sensor - Total Suspended Solids (Not Get)
    Temperature Sensor
    PH Sensor
    TDS Sensor - Total Dissolved Solids
    Continuity Sensor

The second stage of system deployment will include the installation of the following sensors:
    Turbidity Sensor
    Flow Meter
    Water Level Sensor
    Humidity Sensor

The following sensors at the wastewater treatment facility are not included:
    VS Sensor
    Coliform Sensor
