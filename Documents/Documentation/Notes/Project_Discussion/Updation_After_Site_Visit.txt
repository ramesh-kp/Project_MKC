Because the well is deeper than 12 metres, an ultrasonic water level sensor must be installed outside the WIRAS.
2 overhead tanks with a combined capacity of 40,000 litres.
Sensors for sewage treatment plants (STPs) must be installed in a tank near the STP's output.

Overhead Tank 
    There are two tanks in the building (Tank 1 and Tank 2).
    One tank is divided into two pieces once more (Tank 2.1 and Tank 2.2).
    The distance between two tanks is around 60 metres.
    The dam is 150 metres away from the nearest tank.
    The inputs to Tank 1 come from the dam and a well.
    Tank 2.1 receives its water from a well and is solely utilised in the kitchen and cooler (drinking).
    Tank 2.2 is exclusively used for fire protection.
    Because the maximum height of the overhead tank is 5m, wired water level sensors are used in Tank 1, Tank 2.1, and Tank 2.2.
    The tank's input pipe is ASTM 2 inch in diameter (from the dam and well).
    The exit pip has an ASTM diameter of 3 inches.
    Changing the valves allows 2 inch intake pipe to be utilised from the dam and well.

STP Plant
    The STP plant's output is a 1.5-inch PVC pipe.
    Two flow metres are required for the STP plant's intake and output.
    The STP sensors will be mounted in one tank on the exterior of the STP facility.

Conclusion
    Near the tank, there is one edge gadget.
    WIRAS will be linked to the power and RS485 cables of the water level sensor installed in the dam.

    Water level sensors
        3 tanks for 3 tanks (wired type as the tanks are only maximum 5m depth).
        1 for excellent (ultrasonic type as the well is more than 12m depth).
        2 for the dam (height will be calculated by MKC team).

    Sensors for Flowmeters (Need a better clarification)
        1 near the dam's outflow
        1 at the well's outflow
        1 inlet in the kitchen
        There is one in the toilet inlet.
        1 in the intake to the washroom 1 in the inflow of the STP.
        1 at the STP receptacle.

    STP Sensors
        All STP sensors must be immersed in a tank near the STP facility.

    Energymeter
        An RS485 or USB output is required for the energy metre.
        Alternatively, the energy meter's output must be linked to a smart energy metre.

Action Plan from MKC 
--------------------
The dam's depth will be provided by the MKC team.
The MKC team must provide a pipe schematic with each pipe's exact diameter.
The pipe's interior connection is not fully defined.
The number of flowmeters required is determined by the pipe connections.
The quantity of edge devices also plays a role.
A tank must be installed in the STP plant's output by the MKC team.
The STP sensors must be submerged in the tank.
The MKC staff will set up a meeting with the third-party vendor who will purchase and install the gear.
