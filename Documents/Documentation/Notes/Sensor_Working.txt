Energymeter Working
1.  The input voltage is 230 volts single phase.
2.  Loads are connected to the output.
3.  The data is collected via RS485 wires connected to the Gateway Hub.
4.  An ethernet connection connects the Gateway Hub to the Raspberry Pi.
5.  Ckwh, Ckah, Voltage, Power Factor Line 1, Power Factor Line 2, Power Factor Line 3, Total Power Factor, and Frequency are the parameters obtained by the Energymeters.

COD, BOD and TSS Working
1.  The input voltage is 12 v.
2.  Connections are
    Red - Power Cord (VCC)
    Black - Ground (GND)
    Yellow - 485 data line _A (485_A)
    White - 485 data line _B (485_B)
3.  The data is collected via RS485 wires connected to the Gateway Hub.
4.  An ethernet connection connects the Gateway Hub to the Raspberry Pi.
5.  COD, BOD, TSS, and Temperature are the parameters obtained from the sensor.
